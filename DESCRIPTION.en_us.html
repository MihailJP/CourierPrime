<p>Courier Prime is a new take on IBM's Courier classic typeface designed in 1655 by Howard Kettler.</p>

<p>Courier Prime is a monospaced font designed specifically for screenplays. It brings the flavor of its ancestor taking it to another level avoiding blobby forms. The joins and terminal strokes were refined. The serifs are finer, crisper and less rounded and he counters are subtly wider.</p>

<p>The bold weight is a bit darker and its italics have real cursive characteristics. All of its features make Courier Prime gain more definition preventing spotty text color, particularly at small sizes. </p>
