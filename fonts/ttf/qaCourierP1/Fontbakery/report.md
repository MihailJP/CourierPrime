* [com.google.fonts/check/family/underline_thickness](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/post.html#com.google.fonts/check/family/underline_thickness)
* 🔥 **FAIL** Thickness of the underline is not the same accross this family. In order to fix this, please make sure that the underlineThickness value is the same in the 'post' table of all of this family font files.
Detected underlineThickness values are:
	Courier Prime Bold Italic.ttf: 180

* 🔥 **FAIL** Style name used in "Courier Prime Bold Italic.ttf" is not canonical. You should rebuild the font using any of the following style names: "Thin", "ExtraLight", "Light", "Regular", "Medium", "SemiBold", "Bold", "ExtraBold", "Black", "Thin Italic", "ExtraLight Italic", "Light Italic", "Italic", "Medium Italic", "SemiBold Italic", "Bold Italic", "ExtraBold Italic", "Black Italic".

* [com.google.fonts/check/fstype](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/fstype)
* 🔥 **FAIL** OS/2 fsType is a legacy DRM-related field.
In this font it is set to 8 meaning that:
The font may be embedded but must only be installed temporarily on other systems.

No such DRM restrictions can be enabled on the Google Fonts collection, so the fsType field must be set to zero (Installable Embedding) instead.
Fonts with this setting indicate that they may be embedded and permanently installed on the remote system by an application.

The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:

Glyph name: uni00AD	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 1
Glyph name: Dcroat	Contours detected: 3	Expected: 2
Glyph name: minute	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 1

* 🔥 **FAIL** This is a hinted font, so it must have bit 3 set on the flags of the head table, so that PPEM values will be rounded into an integer value.

This can be accomplished by using the 'gftools fix-hinting' command.

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:

Glyph name: uni00AD	Contours detected: 0	Expected: 1
Glyph name: Dcroat	Contours detected: 3	Expected: 2
Glyph name: summation	Contours detected: 3	Expected: 1 [code: contour-count]
